## Inputs

### Example

You may add as many branch-based environment variables as you'd like, in this fashion:

(a step in a job in your workflow file)

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@v1.2.2
  with:
    # optional, just an example of setting a setting
    bevOverwrite: true
    KITCHEN_SINK: |
      master:this is the value for KITCHEN_SINK if we are on the master branch
      staging:this is the value if we are on the staging branch
      another-branch:add as many as you want!
      colon:of course you can put colons in your values: see!
      uses-env-var:our workspace is at: ${{ env.GITHUB_WORKSPACE }}
      these-are-just-branch-names:isn't that cool!
      wildcard/*:this is for branches prefixed by wildcard/
      wildcard/**/feature:sure, we support glob patterns, too. (note that * and ** performs identically)

      # this is a comment! (of course, we support empty lines!)
      # you can also set special values, like the following

      !pr:this is the value if we are building a PR (and we don't match any more specific patterns)
      !pr>basebranch:this is the value if we are building a PR off basebranch
      !pr>feature/*:this is the value if we are building a PR off any branch that starts with feature/
      !pr>feature/**/tested:yep, pr's support glob patterns too, but, again * performs identically to **
      
      !tag:this is the value if we are building a tag
      !default:this is the default value. leaving this out is fine, but the variable might be empty. see bevSetEmptyVars.
      *:avoid this!! read the Wildcards section!!
    STATIC_VAR: 'i am a static env var. static vars may not contain line breaks.'
    I_AM_SECRET: |
      master:${{ secrets.I_AM_SECRET_PROD }}
      staging:${{ secrets.I_AM_SECRET_STG }}
      release/*:${{ secrets.I_AM_SECRET_PRE_PROD }}
      !default:i am not secret
    ANOTHER_EXAMPLE: |
      master:VALUEFORmaster
      !default:DEFAULTvalue
```

### Settings

Settins are prefixed with `bev`.

- `bevOverwrite`: Whether to overwrite other, already-set environment variables with the same name (default `true`)
- `bevActionOnNoRef`: What to do when there is no GITHUB_REF: (default `warn`)
  - `error` (fail the build)
  - `warn` (print a warning but pass)
  - `continue` (pass and continue silently)
  - if any other value is put here, the build will fail
- `bevSetEmptyVars`: Whether to set environment variables with empty values. This may happen if you don't specify a default value.

### Environment variables

We use multi-line YAML strings to store branches and their values. For example,

```yaml
key: |
  multi-line value
```

We use multi-line values because they can contain special characters, like `'`, line breaks, and more.

This action supports setting environment variables for:

- Specific branches by name
- Wildcard branch patterns
- Pull requests
- Tags
- Defaults

It also supports static values.

#### Values by branch name

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      master:valueformaster
      staging:valueforstaging
      release/*:valueforreleasebranches
      !default:defaultvalue
```

In the above example, if the branch is `master`, the value will be `valueformaster`.
If the branch is `staging`, the value will be `valueforstaging`.
If the branch is `release/1.0.0`, the value will be `valueforreleasebranches`.
If we are building anything else, including a pull request, tag, or other branch, the value will be `defaultvalue`.

If we did NOT provide a default, either the environment variable would not be set or it would be set to an empty string, based on your `bevSetEmptyVars` setting.

#### Values for pull requests and tags

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      !pr:valueforapullrequest
      !pr>basebranch:valueforaproffbasebranch
      !pr>feature/*:valueforaprofffeature/
      
      !tag:valueforatag
      !default:valueforanythingelse
```

For pull requests, you can use the special syntax `!pr>branchname` to match on pull requests merging into `branchname`.
This also supports [wildcards](#Wildcards).

In the above example, if the run is for a pull request:
- If the PR is off `basebranch`, the value will be `valueforaproffbasebranch`
- If the PR is off `feature/*` (meaning `feature/foo`, `feature/bar`, etc will match), the value will be `valueforaprofffeature/`
- Finally, if the PR doesn't match either base branch pattern (not off `basebranch` or `feature/*`), the value will be `valueforapullrequest`

If the run is for a tag, the value will be `valueforatag`.
If we are building anything else, like a branch, the value will be `valueforanythingelse`.

#### Wildcards

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      feature/*:value for any feature branch
      !pr>feature/*:value for a pr merging into any feature branch
      
      # note that * and ** do exactly the same thing!
      feature/*/foo:value for any feature branch ending in /foo
      feature/**/bar: value for any feature branch ending in /bar 
      
      # yep, this works for PRs too!
      
      !pr>feature/*:value for any pr merging into feature/*
      !pr>feature/**/bar:value for any pr merging into any feature branch ending in 
      
      !default:valueforanythingelse
```

You can use wildcards (`*` or `**`) in all branch names, including in PR base branch names.

They allow you to, for example, match any branch starting or ending with something.

A couple quirks:
- `*` and `**` perform identically. Please **do not** use more than two `*`s.
- For pull requests, if you just want to match all, you can just do `!pr:value`. You don't need to do `!pr>*`, although they'll both work.
- Wildcards match _any_ characters, include slashes. They're turned into Regex `.*`, so `feature/*` turns into the regular expression `feature/.*`, then we match the regex with your branch name.
- Exact matches are processed before wildcards. So, if you had values for both `feat/foo` and `feat/*` and you're building on the `feat/foo` branch, the value for `feat/foo` will be used, not the value of `feat/*`. This also applies to pull requests.

One quick note on what happens if you do this:
```yaml
EXAMPLE: |
  *:catchall
  !default:defaultcatchall
```

Technically, this will work, and `*` has priority over `!default`, but this is a poor pattern.
Please don't do this. Use `!default` and static variables when necessary.
This leads to weird behavior, is unpredictable, is hard to read, and is **unsupported**, so its functionality may change with updates.
**Don't do this!**

#### Static values

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: 'staticvalueforEXAMPLE'
```

In the above example, the value for `EXAMPLE` will always be `staticvalueforEXAMPLE`.

Note that static variables may not have line breaks.

#### Comments and empty lines

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      master:valueformaster
      # this is a comment

      # you may leave empty lines, that's cool
```

Like YAML, comments are prefixed with a `#`.

Empty lines are not evaluated.

## Common Issues

### Variable value has branch name in it

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: 'master:valueformaster'
```

The value of `EXAMPLE` in the above code is `master:valueformaster`.

This is happening because you're using a static variable declaration (single line).
Switch to multi-line YAML for this to make it work.

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      master:valueformaster
```

The value of `EXAMPLE` is now `valueformaster`.

This happens because we use the presence of a line break to detect static environment variables.
YAML automatically appends a line break to multi-line strings, so every multi-line declaration is non-static.

```yaml
- name: Set branch-based environment variables
  uses: iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...
  with:
    EXAMPLE: |
      master:valueformaster
    SOMETHING_ELSE: |
    	master:somethingelse
        staging:somethingelsestaging

```

The above YAML converts to the following JSON, where you can see the line breaks.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Set branch-based environment variables",
    "uses": "iamtheyammer/branch-env-vars@...",
    "with": {
      "EXAMPLE": "master:valueformaster\n",
      "SOMETHING_ELSE": "master:somethingelse\nstaging:somethingelsestaging\n"
    }
  }
]
```

If you're still having this issue with a multiline declaration, make there's a newline after your last character in the multi-line declaration.

This warning is caused by the way GitHub parses `with` data. Don't worry about it.

## Contributing

Many folks have already contributed to this repo, and I'm so grateful to them.

I absolutely appreciate pull requests adding and fixing functionality-- although if you'd like to add functionality I humbly ask that you create an issue first so that we can discuss how the feature will work.

Also, please note that I'm a full-time student, so I may not be able to respond as quickly as I'd like, but this project is actively maintained.
